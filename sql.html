                        <div class="ans">A database is a collection of Data or Information.
                            Every database has at least one or more tables.
                            Each table has its own unique name and consists of columns and rows.
                            There are few kinds of database such as Oracle, Sybase, and DB2.

                            The DECODE function allows you to perform If-Then-Else logic in SQL without having to use
                            PL/SQL.
                            Ex: - DECODE (Job_id, 'IT_PROG', salary*1.10,
                            2nd condition) increase_salary

                            <li>A join condition is used, when data from more than one table is required.
                                Row in one table can be joined to rows in another table according to common values
                                existing in corresponding columns that is usually primary and foreign key column.

                            SELF JOIN is a normal join which is used to join a table to itself. The SQL self-join can be
                            done by using table aliases to treat one table like a different table and then join them
                            together.

                            database for database testing.
                            I often do the back end testing while I do the functional testing
                            For verifying my requirement I need to retrieve data from the database.
                            So I write SQL query manually to retrieve data and analysis the data that meet my
                            requirement or not.

                            UNION select related information from two tables, much like the JOIN command. However, when
                            using the UNION command all selected columns need to be of the same data type.
                            SELECT E_Name FROM Employees_Norway
                            UNION
                            SELECT E_Name FROM Employees_USA
                            In SQL the UNION clause combines the results of two SQL queries into a single table of all
                            matching rows.

                            The UNION ALL command is equal to the UNION command, except that UNION ALL selects all
                            values.
